# OSSF Scorecard Configuration

# This file helps OSSF Scorecard understand the security practices in this repository

# Fuzzing Configuration
# The project implements continuous fuzzing with:
# - Atheris (Google's coverage-guided fuzzing engine for Python)
# - Hypothesis (property-based testing)
# - GitHub Actions integration for automated fuzzing
# - OSS-Fuzz compatibility preparation

# Fuzzing is implemented in:
# - .github/workflows/fuzzing.yml (CI integration)
# - fuzz/ directory (fuzzing targets and tests)
# - Daily scheduled fuzzing runs
# - Fuzzing on every PR and push

# Security Practices Implemented:
# ✅ Automated security scanning (via fuzzing)
# ✅ Continuous testing with multiple approaches
# ✅ Artifact retention for crash analysis
# ✅ Structured fuzzing targets for parser code
# ✅ Property-based testing for edge cases
